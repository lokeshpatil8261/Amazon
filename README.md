Amazon clone Project
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Developed a responsive and interactive clone of the Amazon website to simulate core e-commerce functionalities. The project replicates the UI and UX of Amazonâ€™s homepage, product listings, and cart system to demonstrate front-end and (optionally) back-end development skills.
